## Drafting Instructions

1. Open with a compelling hook that speaks directly to the target audience's pain or curiosity.
2. Structure the post with clear `##` and `###` headings.
3. Include at least one code example (use a fenced code block with the correct language tag).
4. Keep paragraphs short — maximum 4 sentences each.
5. Close with a concrete next step or call to action.
6. Aim for exactly ${ word_count } words in the final draft.
7. Do not use the word "delve".
